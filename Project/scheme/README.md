Hi there ðŸ‘‹

In this project, I developed an interpreter for a subset of the Scheme language.

Main functions of the interpreter developed:
- Reading Scheme expressions
- Symbol evaluation
- Calling built-in procedures
- Definitions
- Lambda expressions and procedure definition
- Calling user-defined procedures
- Evaluation of special forms

The main codes of the interpreter logic is implemented in `scheme.py` and `scheme_reader.py`. 
To try the interpreter, download all the files in this folder. In your terminal, run `python3 scheme.py`, then an interactive Scheme interpreter session will start. Have fun!
