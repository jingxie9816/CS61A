Hi there :wave:

In this project, I developed a program that measures typing speed, with the option to enable autocorrect feature, which attempts to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. Furthermore, you can match with another player to make it a contest!


The main codes of the game logic is implemented in `cats.py`. To play this game, download all the files in this folder. In your terminal, run `python3 gui.py`, then a interactive website will pop up.
Have fun!
