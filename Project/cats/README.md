Hi! :wave:
In this project, I developed a program that measures typing speed, with the option to enable autocorrect feature, attempting to correct the spelling of a word after a user types it. Furthermore, you can match with another player to make it a contest!

To play this game, download all the files in this folder. In your terminal, run `python3 gui.py`, then a interactive website will pop up.
Have fun! 👏
